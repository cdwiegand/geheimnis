<li>Choose your profile
<p>When you choose your profile, Geheimnis will load your keyring for later
steps.</p>
<li>Choose who to sign as, if you're signing.
<p>Simply pull down your secret key to use for signing, if you want to sign.
If you're not signing, just ignore this area and make sure Sign isn't
checked.</p>
<li>Choose who to encrypt to, if you're encrypting.
<p>Click, Shift-Click, or Control-Click, to select your recipients to
encrypt to. If you aren't encrypting, simply leave this area blank, and make
sure Encrypt isn't checked.</p>
<li>If you're familiar with encryption, select Advanced Options...
<p>If you're <b>NOT</b> familiar with encryption, simply leave the options
at the bottom at their defaults, as they are pre-set for what most people
want. If you want to learn what these options are for, I recommend you read
the documentation, possibly as "man" pages, for your encryption program.</p>
<li>Click Go.
