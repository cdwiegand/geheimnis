<h1>Key Management - Adding / Importing a Key</h1>
<hr>
<p>This section deals with two concepts: Generating your own pair of keys,
and importing other's keys.</p>

<h1>Generating a Key Pair</h1>
<p>To generate your own key pair, go into Key Management -> Generate Key
Pair... This will lead in your encryption program's method for generating
new keys.</p>

<h1>Importing Keys</h1>
<p>To import someone else's key, there are three methods:
<ol>
<li>Getting them from a keyserver
<li>Getting them from the clipboard
<li>Getting them from a file
</ol><BR>

You can select any of these three from the Key Management -> Import Key...
menu item. You can also right-click on a specific key and select Import
Key... to import that specific key.</p>
